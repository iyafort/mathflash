# ðŸš€ GitHub Pages Deployment Guide

This guide will help you deploy your Math Flash application to GitHub Pages.

## Prerequisites

- GitHub account
- Git installed on your computer
- Flutter SDK installed

## Step-by-Step Deployment

### 1. Create a GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and sign in
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner
3. Select "New repository"
4. Name your repository (e.g., `mathflash`)
5. Make it public (required for free GitHub Pages)
6. Don't initialize with README (we already have one)
7. Click "Create repository"

### 2. Push Your Code to GitHub

Open a terminal/command prompt in your project directory and run:

```bash
# Initialize git repository (if not already done)
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit the changes
git commit -m "Initial commit: Math Flash application"

# Add the remote repository (replace with your repository URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/mathflash.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. Build the Web Version

Run one of these commands in your project directory:

**Windows:**
```bash
deploy.bat
```

**Linux/Mac:**
```bash
chmod +x deploy.sh
./deploy.sh
```

**Manual:**
```bash
flutter build web --release
```

### 4. Deploy to GitHub Pages

#### Option A: Manual Deployment

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click on "Settings" tab
3. Scroll down to "Pages" section
4. Under "Source", select "Deploy from a branch"
5. Choose "main" branch
6. Set folder to `/docs`
7. Click "Save"

8. Create a `docs` folder in your repository root
9. Copy all contents from `build/web/` to the `docs/` folder
10. Commit and push the changes:

```bash
mkdir docs
cp -r build/web/* docs/
git add docs/
git commit -m "Add web build for GitHub Pages"
git push
```

#### Option B: Automatic Deployment (Recommended)

1. The GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) will automatically deploy your app
2. Just push your changes to the main branch
3. Go to your repository â†’ Actions tab to monitor the deployment
4. Once complete, your app will be available at `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/mathflash`

### 5. Verify Deployment

1. Wait a few minutes for GitHub Pages to build and deploy
2. Visit your app at: `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/mathflash`
3. Test all features to ensure everything works correctly

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **404 Error**
   - Ensure the repository is public
   - Check that the correct branch and folder are selected in Pages settings
   - Wait a few minutes for the initial deployment

2. **Build Failures**
   - Check the Actions tab for error messages
   - Ensure all dependencies are properly declared in `pubspec.yaml`
   - Verify that Flutter version is compatible

3. **Assets Not Loading**
   - Ensure all assets are declared in `pubspec.yaml`
   - Check that file paths are correct
   - Verify that asset files are included in the repository

### Performance Optimization

1. **Enable Compression**
   - GitHub Pages automatically serves compressed files
   - Ensure your build uses release mode: `flutter build web --release`

2. **Optimize Assets**
   - Compress images before adding to assets
   - Use appropriate image formats (PNG for graphics, JPG for photos)

3. **Cache Strategy**
   - Flutter web automatically handles caching
   - Consider using service workers for offline functionality

## Custom Domain (Optional)

If you want to use a custom domain:

1. Purchase a domain name
2. Add a `CNAME` file to your repository root with your domain
3. Update your domain's DNS settings to point to `YOUR_USERNAME.github.io`
4. In repository Settings â†’ Pages, enter your custom domain

## Support

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the [GitHub Pages documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pages)
2. Review the [Flutter web deployment guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/deployment/web)
3. Create an issue in your repository with detailed error information
